title: Why Do We Write super(props)?

spoiler: Thereâ€™s a twist at the end.

I heard [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are the new hotness. Ironically, I want to start this blog by describing fun facts about *class* components. How about that!

**These gotchas are *not* important for using React productively. But you might find them amusing if you like to dig deeper into how things work.**

Hereâ€™s the first one.

---

I wrote `super(props)` more times in my life than Iâ€™d like to know:

```jsx{3}
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
  // ...
}
```

Of course, the [class fields proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) lets us skip the ceremony:

```jsx
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  state = { isOn: true };
  // ...
}
```

A syntax like this was [planned](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#es7-property-initializers) when React 0.13 added support for plain classes in 2015. Defining `constructor` and calling `super(props)` was always intended to be a temporary solution until class fields provide an ergonomic alternative.

But letâ€™s get back to this example using only ES2015 features:

```jsx{3}
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Why do we call `super`? Can we *not* call it? If we have to call it, what happens if we donâ€™t pass `props`? Are there any other arguments?** Letâ€™s find out.

---

In JavaScript, `super` refers to the parent class constructor. (In our example, it points to the `React.Component` implementation.)

Importantly, you canâ€™t use `this` in a constructor until *after* youâ€™ve called the parent constructor. JavaScript wonâ€™t let you:

```jsx
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    // ðŸ”´ Canâ€™t use `this` yet
    super(props);
    // âœ… Now itâ€™s okay though
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
  // ...
}
```

Thereâ€™s a good reason for why JavaScript enforces that parent constructor runs before you touch `this`. Consider a class hierarchy:

```jsx
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class PolitePerson extends Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.greetColleagues(); // ðŸ”´ This is disallowed, read below why
    super(name);
  }
  greetColleagues() {
    alert('Good morning folks!');
  }
}
```

Imagine using `this` before `super` call *was* allowed. A month later, we might change `greetColleagues` to include the personâ€™s name in the message:

```jsx
  greetColleagues() {
    alert('Good morning folks!');
    alert('My name is ' + this.name + ', nice to meet you!');
  }
```

But we forgot that `this.greetColleagues()` is called before the `super()` call had a chance to set up `this.name`. So `this.name` isnâ€™t even defined yet! As you can see, code like this can be very difficult to think about.

To avoid such pitfalls, **JavaScript enforces that if you want to use `this` in a constructor, you *have to* call `super` first.** Let the parent do its thing! And this limitation applies to React components defined as classes too:

```jsx
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // âœ… Okay to use `this` now
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
```

This leaves us with another question: why pass `props`?

---

You might think that passing `props` down to `super` is necessary so that the base `React.Component` constructor can initialize `this.props`:

```jsx
// Inside React
class Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.props = props;
    // ...
  }
}
```

And thatâ€™s not far from truth â€” indeed, thatâ€™s [what it does](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1d25aa5787d4e19704c049c3cfa985d3b5190e0d/packages/react/src/ReactBaseClasses.js#L22).

But somehow, even if you call `super()` without the `props` argument, youâ€™ll still be able to access `this.props` in the `render` and other methods. (If you donâ€™t believe me, try it yourself!)

How does *that* work? It turns out that **React also assigns `props` on the instance right after calling *your* constructor:**

```jsx
  // Inside React
  const instance = new YourComponent(props);
  instance.props = props;
```

So even if you forget to pass `props` to `super()`, React would still set them right afterwards. There is a reason for that.

When React added support for classes, it didnâ€™t just add support for ES6 classes alone. The goal was to support as wide range of class abstractions as possible. It was [not clear](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#other-languages) how relatively successful would ClojureScript, CoffeeScript, ES6, Fable, Scala.js, TypeScript, or other solutions be for defining components. So React was intentionally unopinionated about whether calling `super()` is required â€” even though ES6 classes are.

So does this mean you can just write `super()` instead of `super(props)`?

**Probably not because itâ€™s still confusing.** Sure, React would later assign `this.props` *after* your constructor has run. But `this.props` would still be undefined *between* the `super` call and the end of your constructor:

```jsx{14}
// Inside React
class Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.props = props;
    // ...
  }
}

// Inside your code
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(); // ðŸ˜¬ We forgot to pass props
    console.log(props);      // âœ… {}
    console.log(this.props); // ðŸ˜¬ undefined 
  }
  // ...
}
```

It can be even more challenging to debug if this happens in some method thatâ€™s called *from* the constructor. **And thatâ€™s why I recommend always passing down `super(props)`, even though it isnâ€™t strictly necessary:**

```jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // âœ… We passed props
    console.log(props);      // âœ… {}
    console.log(this.props); // âœ… {}
  }
  // ...
}
```

This ensures `this.props` is set even before the constructor exits.

Thereâ€™s one last bit that longtime React users might be curious about.

You might have noticed that when you use the Context API in classes (either with the legacy `contextTypes` or the modern `contextType` API added in React 16.6), `context` is passed as a second argument to the constructor.

So why donâ€™t we write `super(props, context)` instead? We could, but context is used less often so this pitfall just doesnâ€™t come up as much.

**With the class fields proposal this whole pitfall mostly disappears anyway.** Without an explicit constructor, all arguments are passed down automatically. This is what allows an expression like `state = {}` to include references to `this.props` or `this.context` if necessary.

With Hooks, we donâ€™t even have `super` or `this`. But thatâ€™s a topic for another day.
