title: Why Do We Write super(props)?

spoiler: There’s a twist at the end.

I heard [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are the new hotness. Ironically, I want to start this blog by describing fun facts about *class* components. How about that!

**These gotchas are *not* important for using React productively. But you might find them amusing if you like to dig deeper into how things work.**

Here’s the first one.

---

I wrote `super(props)` more times in my life than I’d like to know:

```jsx{3}
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
  // ...
}
```

Of course, the [class fields proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) lets us skip the ceremony:

```jsx
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  state = { isOn: true };
  // ...
}
```

A syntax like this was [planned](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#es7-property-initializers) when React 0.13 added support for plain classes in 2015. Defining `constructor` and calling `super(props)` was always intended to be a temporary solution until class fields provide an ergonomic alternative.

But let’s get back to this example using only ES2015 features:

```jsx{3}
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Why do we call `super`? Can we *not* call it? If we have to call it, what happens if we don’t pass `props`? Are there any other arguments?** Let’s find out.

---

In JavaScript, `super` refers to the parent class constructor. (In our example, it points to the `React.Component` implementation.)

Importantly, you can’t use `this` in a constructor until *after* you’ve called the parent constructor. JavaScript won’t let you:

```jsx
class Checkbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    // 🔴 Can’t use `this` yet
    super(props);
    // ✅ Now it’s okay though
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
  // ...
}
```

There’s a good reason for why JavaScript enforces that parent constructor runs before you touch `this`. Consider a class hierarchy:

```jsx
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class PolitePerson extends Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.greetColleagues(); // 🔴 This is disallowed, read below why
    super(name);
  }
  greetColleagues() {
    alert('Good morning folks!');
  }
}
```

Imagine using `this` before `super` call *was* allowed. A month later, we might change `greetColleagues` to include the person’s name in the message:

```jsx
  greetColleagues() {
    alert('Good morning folks!');
    alert('My name is ' + this.name + ', nice to meet you!');
  }
```

But we forgot that `this.greetColleagues()` is called before the `super()` call had a chance to set up `this.name`. So `this.name` isn’t even defined yet! As you can see, code like this can be very difficult to think about.

To avoid such pitfalls, **JavaScript enforces that if you want to use `this` in a constructor, you *have to* call `super` first.** Let the parent do its thing! And this limitation applies to React components defined as classes too:

```jsx
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // ✅ Okay to use `this` now
    this.state = { isOn: true };
  }
```

This leaves us with another question: why pass `props`?

---

You might think that passing `props` down to `super` is necessary so that the base `React.Component` constructor can initialize `this.props`:

```jsx
// Inside React
class Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.props = props;
    // ...
  }
}
```

And that’s not far from truth — indeed, that’s [what it does](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1d25aa5787d4e19704c049c3cfa985d3b5190e0d/packages/react/src/ReactBaseClasses.js#L22).

But somehow, even if you call `super()` without the `props` argument, you’ll still be able to access `this.props` in the `render` and other methods. (If you don’t believe me, try it yourself!)

How does *that* work? It turns out that **React also assigns `props` on the instance right after calling *your* constructor:**

```jsx
  // Inside React
  const instance = new YourComponent(props);
  instance.props = props;
```

So even if you forget to pass `props` to `super()`, React would still set them right afterwards. There is a reason for that.

When React added support for classes, it didn’t just add support for ES6 classes alone. The goal was to support as wide range of class abstractions as possible. It was [not clear](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#other-languages) how relatively successful would ClojureScript, CoffeeScript, ES6, Fable, Scala.js, TypeScript, or other solutions be for defining components. So React was intentionally unopinionated about whether calling `super()` is required — even though ES6 classes are.

So does this mean you can just write `super()` instead of `super(props)`?

**Probably not because it’s still confusing.** Sure, React would later assign `this.props` *after* your constructor has run. But `this.props` would still be undefined *between* the `super` call and the end of your constructor:

```jsx{14}
// Inside React
class Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.props = props;
    // ...
  }
}

// Inside your code
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(); // 😬 We forgot to pass props
    console.log(props);      // ✅ {}
    console.log(this.props); // 😬 undefined 
  }
  // ...
}
```

It can be even more challenging to debug if this happens in some method that’s called *from* the constructor. **And that’s why I recommend always passing down `super(props)`, even though it isn’t strictly necessary:**

```jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // ✅ We passed props
    console.log(props);      // ✅ {}
    console.log(this.props); // ✅ {}
  }
  // ...
}
```

This ensures `this.props` is set even before the constructor exits.

There’s one last bit that longtime React users might be curious about.

You might have noticed that when you use the Context API in classes (either with the legacy `contextTypes` or the modern `contextType` API added in React 16.6), `context` is passed as a second argument to the constructor.

So why don’t we write `super(props, context)` instead? We could, but context is used less often so this pitfall just doesn’t come up as much.

**With the class fields proposal this whole pitfall mostly disappears anyway.** Without an explicit constructor, all arguments are passed down automatically. This is what allows an expression like `state = {}` to include references to `this.props` or `this.context` if necessary.

With Hooks, we don’t even have `super` or `this`. But that’s a topic for another day.
