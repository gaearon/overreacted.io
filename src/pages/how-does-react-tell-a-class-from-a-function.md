title: How Does React Tell a Class from a Function?
date: '2018-12-02'
spoiler: We talk about classes, new, instanceof, prototype chains, and API design.
---

Consider this `Greeting` component which is defined as a function:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <p>Hello</p>;
}
```

React also supports defining it as a class:

```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Hello</p>;
  }
}
```

(Until [recently](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), that was the only way to use features like state.)

When you want to render a `<Greeting />`, you don‚Äôt care how it‚Äôs defined:

```jsx
// Class or function ‚Äî whatever.
<Greeting />
```

But *React itself* cares about the difference!

If `Greeting` is a function, React needs to call it:

```jsx
// Your code
function Greeting() {
  return <p>Hello</p>;
}

// Inside React
const result = Greeting(props); // <p>Hello</p>
```

But if `Greeting` is a class, React needs to instantiate it with the `new` operator and *then* call the `render` method on the just created instance:

```jsx
// Your code
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Hello</p>;
  }
}

// Inside React
const instance = new Greeting(props); // Greeting {}
const result = instance.render(); // <p>Hello</p>
```

In both cases React‚Äôs goal is to get the rendered node (in this example, `<p>Hello</p>`). But the exact steps depend on how `Greeting` is defined.

**So how does React know if something is a class or a function?**

Just like in my [previous post](/why-do-we-write-super-props/), **you don‚Äôt *need* to know this to be productive in React.** I didn‚Äôt know this for years. Please don‚Äôt turn this into an interview question. In fact, this post is more about JavaScript than it is about React.

This blog is for a curious reader who wants to know *why* React works in a certain way. Are you that person? Then let‚Äôs dig in together.

**This is a long journey. Buckle up. This post doesn‚Äôt have much information about React itself, but we‚Äôll go through some aspects of `new`, `this`, `class`, arrow functions, `prototype`, `__proto__`, `instanceof`, and how those things work together in JavaScript. Luckily, you don‚Äôt need to think about those as much when you *use* React. If you‚Äôre implementing React though...**

(If you really just want to know the answer, scroll to the very end.)

----

First, we need to understand why it‚Äôs important to treat functions and classes differently. Note how we use the `new` operator when calling a class:

```jsx{5}
// If Greeting is a function
const result = Greeting(props); // <p>Hello</p>

// If Greeting is a class
const instance = new Greeting(props); // Greeting {}
const result = instance.render(); // <p>Hello</p>
```

Let‚Äôs get a rough sense of what the `new` operator does in JavaScript.

---

In the old days, JavaScript did not have classes. However, you could express a similar pattern to classes using plain functions. **Concretely, you can use *any* function in a role similar to a class constructor by adding `new` before its call:**

```jsx
// Just a function
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

var fred = new Person('Fred'); // ‚úÖ Person {name: 'Fred'}
var george = Person('George'); // üî¥ Won‚Äôt work
```

You can still write code like this today! Try it in DevTools.

If you called `Person('Fred')` **without** `new`, `this` inside it would point to something global and useless (for example, `window` or `undefined`). So our code would crash or do something silly like setting `window.name`.

By adding `new` before the call, we say: ‚ÄúHey JavaScript, I know `Person` is just a function but let‚Äôs pretend it‚Äôs something like a class constructor. **Create an `{}` object and point `this` inside the `Person` function to that object so I can assign stuff like `this.name`. Then give that object back to me.**‚Äù

That‚Äôs what the `new` operator does.

```jsx
var fred = new Person('Fred'); // Same object as `this` inside `Person`
```

The `new` operator also makes anything we put on `Person.prototype` available on the `fred` object:

```jsx{4-6,9}
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  alert('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
}

var fred = new Person('Fred');
fred.sayHi();
```

This is how people emulated classes before JavaScript added them directly.

---

So `new` has been around in JavaScript for a while. However, classes are more recent. They let us rewrite the code above to match our intent more closely:

```jsx
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHi() {
    alert('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
  }
}

let fred = new Person('Fred');
fred.sayHi();
```

*Capturing developer‚Äôs intent* is important in language and API design.

If you write a function, JavaScript can‚Äôt guess if it‚Äôs meant to be called like `alert()` or if it serves as a constructor like `new Person()`. Forgetting to specify `new` for a function like `Person` would lead to confusing behavior.

**Class syntax lets us say: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a function ‚Äî it‚Äôs a class and it has a constructor‚Äù.** If you forget `new` when calling it, JavaScript will raise an error:

```jsx
let fred = new Person('Fred');
// ‚úÖ  If Person is a function: works fine
// ‚úÖ  If Person is a class: works fine too

let george = Person('George'); // We forgot `new`
// üò≥ If Person is a constructor-like function: confusing behavior
// üî¥ If Person is a class: fails immediately
```

This helps us catch mistakes early instead of waiting for some obscure bug like `this.name` being treated as `window.name` instead of `george.name`.

However, it means that React needs to put `new` before calling any class. It can‚Äôt just call it as a regular function, as JavaScript would treat it as an error!

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Hello</p>;
  }
}

// üî¥ React can't just do this:
const instance = Counter(props);
```

This spells trouble.

---

Before we see how React solves this, it‚Äôs important to remember most people using React use compilers like Babel to compile away modern features like classes for older browsers. So we need to consider compilers in our design.

In early versions of Babel, classes could be called without `new`. However, this was fixed ‚Äî by generating some extra code:

```jsx
function Person(name) {
  // A bit simplified from Babel output:
  if (!(this instanceof Person)) {
    throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function");
  }
  // Our code:
  this.name = name;
}

new Person('Fred'); // ‚úÖ Okay
Person('George');   // üî¥ Cannot call a class as a function
``` 

You might have seen code like this in your bundle. That‚Äôs what all those `_classCallCheck` functions do. (You can reduce the bundle size by opting into the ‚Äúloose mode‚Äù with no checks but this might complicate your eventual transition to real native classes.)

---

By now, you should roughly understand the difference between calling something with `new` or without `new`:

|  | `new Person()` | `Person()` |
|---|---|---|
| `class` | ‚úÖ `this` is a `Person` instance | üî¥ `TypeError`
| `function` | ‚úÖ `this` is a `Person` instance | üò≥ `this` is `window` or `undefined` |

This is why it‚Äôs important for React to call your component correctly. **If your component is defined as a class, React needs to use `new` when calling it.**

So can React just check if something is a class or not?

Not so easy! Even if we could [tell a class from a function in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29093396/how-do-you-check-the-difference-between-an-ecmascript-6-class-and-function), this still wouldn‚Äôt work for classes processed by tools like Babel. To the browser, they‚Äôre just plain functions. Tough luck for React.

---

Okay, so maybe React could just use `new` on every call? Unfortunately, that doesn‚Äôt always work either.

With regular functions, calling them with `new` would give them an object instance as `this`. It‚Äôs desirable for functions written as constructor (like our `Person` above), but it would be confusing for function components:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  // We wouldn‚Äôt expect `this` to be any kind of instance here
  return <p>Hello</p>;
}
```

That could be tolerable though. There are two *other* reasons that kill this idea.

---

The first reason why always using `new` wouldn‚Äôt work is that for native arrow functions (not the ones compiled by Babel), calling with `new` throws an error:

```jsx
const Greeting = () => <p>Hello</p>;
new Greeting(); // üî¥ Greeting is not a constructor
```

This behavior is intentional and follows from the design of arrow functions. One of the main perks of arrow functions is that they *don‚Äôt* have their own `this` value ‚Äî instead, `this` is resolved from the closest regular function:

```jsx{2,6,7}
class Friends extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const friends = this.props.friends;
    return friends.map(friend =>
      <Friend
        // `this` is resolved from the `render` method
        size={this.props.size}
        name={friend.name}
        key={friend.id}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Okay, so **arrow functions don‚Äôt have their own `this`.** But that means they would be entirely useless as constructors!

```jsx
const Person = (name) => {
  // üî¥ This wouldn‚Äôt make sense!
  this.name = name;
}
```

Therefore, **JavaScript disallows calling an arrow function with `new`.** If you do it, you probably made a mistake anyway, and it‚Äôs best to tell you early. This is similar to how JavaScript doesn‚Äôt let you call a class *without* `new`.

This is nice but it also foils our plan. React can‚Äôt just call `new` on everything because it would break arrow functions! We could try detecting arrow functions specifically by their lack of `prototype`, and not `new` just them:

```jsx
(() => {}).prototype // undefined
(function() {}).prototype // {constructor: f}
```

But this [wouldn‚Äôt work](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4599#issuecomment-136562930) for functions compiled with Babel. This might not be a big deal, but there is another reason that makes this approach a dead end.

---

Another reason we can‚Äôt always use `new` is that it would preclude React from supporting components that return strings or other primitive types.

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return 'Hello';
}

Greeting(); // ‚úÖ 'Hello'
new Greeting(); // üò≥ Greeting¬†{}
```

This, again, has to do with the quirks of the [`new` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) design. As we saw earlier, `new` tells the JavaScript engine to create an object, make that object `this` inside the function, and later give us that object as a result of `new`.

However, JavaScript also allows a function called with `new` to *override* the return value of `new` by returning some other object. Presumably, this was considered useful for patterns like pooling where we want to reuse instances:

```jsx{1-2,7-8,17-18}
// Created lazily
var zeroVector = null;

function Vector(x, y) {
  if (x === 0 && y === 0) {
    if (zeroVector !== null) {
      // Reuse the same instance
      return zeroVector;
    }
    zeroVector = this;
  }
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}

var a = new Vector(1, 1);
var b = new Vector(0, 0);
var c = new Vector(0, 0); // üò≤ b === c
```

However, `new` also *completely ignores* a function‚Äôs return value if it‚Äôs *not* an object. If you return a string or a number, it‚Äôs like there was no `return` at all.

```jsx
function Answer() {
  return 42;
}

Answer(); // ‚úÖ 42
new Answer(); // üò≥ Answer {}
```

There is just no way to read a primitive return value (like a number or a string) from a function when calling it with `new`. So if React always used `new`, it would be unable to add support components that return strings!

That‚Äôs unacceptable so we need to compromise.

---

What did we learn so far? React needs to call classes (including Babel output) *with* `new` but it needs to call regular functions or arrow functions (including Babel output) *without* `new`. And there is no reliable way to distinguish them.

**If we can‚Äôt solve a general problem, can we solve a more specific one?**

When you define a component as a class, you‚Äôll likely want to extend `React.Component` for built-in methods like `this.setState()`. **Rather than try to detect all classes, can we detect only `React.Component` descendants?**

Spoiler: this is exactly what React does.

---

Perhaps, the idiomatic way to check if `Greeting` is a React component class is by testing if `Greeting.prototype instanceof React.Component`:

```jsx
class A {}
class B extends A {}

console.log(B.prototype instanceof A); // true
```

I know what you‚Äôre thinking. What just happened here?! To answer this, we need to understand JavaScript prototypes.

You might be familiar with the ‚Äúprototype chain‚Äù. Every object in JavaScript might have a ‚Äúprototype‚Äù. When we write `fred.sayHi()` but `fred` object has no `sayHi` property, we look for `sayHi` property on `fred`‚Äôs prototype. If we don‚Äôt find it there, we look at the next prototype in the chain ‚Äî `fred`‚Äôs prototype‚Äôs prototype. And so on.

**Confusingly, the `prototype` property of a class or a function _does not_ point to the prototype of that value.** I‚Äôm not kidding.

```jsx
function Person() {}

console.log(Person.prototype); // ü§™ Not Person's prototype
console.log(Person.__proto__); // üò≥ Person's prototype
```

So the ‚Äúprototype chain‚Äù is more like `__proto__.__proto__.__proto__` than `prototype.prototype.prototype`. This took me years to get.

What‚Äôs the `prototype` property on a function or a class, then? **It‚Äôs the `__proto__` given to all objects `new`ed with that class or a function!**

```jsx{8}
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  alert('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
}

var fred = new Person('Fred'); // Sets `fred.__proto__` to `Person.prototype`
```

And that `__proto__` chain is how JavaScript looks up properties:

```jsx
fred.sayHi();
// 1. Does fred have a sayHi property? No.
// 2. Does fred.__proto__ have a sayHi property? Yes. Call it!

fred.toString();
// 1. Does fred have a toString property? No.
// 2. Does fred.__proto__ have a toString property? No.
// 3. Does fred.__proto__.__proto__ have a toString property? Yes. Call it!
```

In practice, you should almost never need to touch `__proto__` from the code directly unless you‚Äôre debugging something related to the prototype chain. If you want to make stuff available on `fred.__proto__`, you‚Äôre supposed to put it on `Person.prototype`. At least that‚Äôs how it was originally designed.

The `__proto__` property wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be exposed by browsers at first because the prototype chain was considered an internal concept. But some browsers added `__proto__` and eventually it was begrudgingly standardized (but deprecated in favor of `Object.getPrototypeOf()`).

**And yet I still find it very confusing that a property called `prototype` does not give you a value‚Äôs prototype** (for example, `fred.prototype` is undefined because `fred` is not a function). Personally, I think this is the biggest reason even experienced developers tend to misunderstand JavaScript prototypes.

---

This is a long post, eh? I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre 80% there. Hang on.

We know that when say `obj.foo`, JavaScript actually looks for `foo` in `obj`, `obj.__proto__`, `obj.__proto__.__proto__`, and so on.

With classes, you‚Äôre not exposed directly to this mechanism, but `extends` also works on top of the good old prototype chain. That‚Äôs how our React class instance gets access to methods like `setState`:

```jsx{1,9,13}
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Hello</p>;
  }
}

let c = new Greeting();
console.log(c.__proto__); // Greeting.prototype
console.log(c.__proto__.__proto__); // React.Component.prototype
console.log(c.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); // Object.prototype

c.render();      // Found on c.__proto__ (Greeting.prototype)
c.setState();    // Found on c.__proto__.__proto__ (React.Component.prototype)
c.toString();    // Found on c.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ (Object.prototype)
```

In other words, **when you use classes, an instance‚Äôs `__proto__` chain ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù the class hierarchy:**

```jsx
// `extends` chain
Greeting
  ‚Üí React.Component
    ‚Üí Object (implicitly)

// `__proto__` chain
new Greeting()
  ‚Üí Greeting.prototype
    ‚Üí React.Component.prototype
      ‚Üí Object.prototype
```

2 Chainz.

---

Since the `__proto__` chain mirrors the class hierarchy, we can check whether a `Greeting` extends `React.Component` by starting with `Greeting.prototype`, and then following down its `__proto__` chain:

```jsx{3,4}
// `__proto__` chain
new Greeting()
  ‚Üí Greeting.prototype // üïµÔ∏è We start here
    ‚Üí React.Component.prototype // ‚úÖ Found it!
      ‚Üí Object.prototype
```

Conveniently, `x instanceof Y` does exactly this kind of search. It follows the `x.__proto__` chain looking for `Y.prototype` there.

Normally, it‚Äôs used to determine whether something is an instance of a class:

```jsx
let greeting = new Greeting();

console.log(greeting instanceof Greeting); // true
// greeting (üïµÔ∏è‚Äç We start here)
//   .__proto__ ‚Üí Greeting.prototype (‚úÖ Found it!)
//     .__proto__ ‚Üí React.Component.prototype 
//       .__proto__ ‚Üí Object.prototype

console.log(greeting instanceof React.Component); // true
// greeting (üïµÔ∏è‚Äç We start here)
//   .__proto__ ‚Üí Greeting.prototype
//     .__proto__ ‚Üí React.Component.prototype (‚úÖ Found it!)
//       .__proto__ ‚Üí Object.prototype

console.log(greeting instanceof Object); // true
// greeting (üïµÔ∏è‚Äç We start here)
//   .__proto__ ‚Üí Greeting.prototype
//     .__proto__ ‚Üí React.Component.prototype
//       .__proto__ ‚Üí Object.prototype (‚úÖ Found it!)

console.log(greeting instanceof Banana); // false
// greeting (üïµÔ∏è‚Äç We start here)
//   .__proto__ ‚Üí Greeting.prototype
//     .__proto__ ‚Üí React.Component.prototype 
//       .__proto__ ‚Üí Object.prototype (üôÖ‚Äç Did not find it!)
```

But it would work just as fine to determine if a class extends another class:

```jsx
console.log(Greeting.prototype instanceof React.Component);
// greeting
//   .__proto__ ‚Üí Greeting.prototype (üïµÔ∏è‚Äç We start here)
//     .__proto__ ‚Üí React.Component.prototype (‚úÖ Found it!)
//       .__proto__ ‚Üí Object.prototype
```

And that check is how we could determine if something is a React component class or a regular function.

---

That‚Äôs not what React does though. üò≥

One caveat to the `instanceof` solution is that it doesn‚Äôt work when there are multiple copies of React on the page, and the component we‚Äôre checking inherits from *another* React copy‚Äôs `React.Component`. Mixing multiple copies of React in a single project is bad for several reasons but historically we‚Äôve tried to avoid issues when possible. (With Hooks, we [might need to](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991) force deduplication though.)

One other possible heuristic could be to check for presence of a `render` method on the prototype. However, at the time it [wasn‚Äôt clear](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4599#issuecomment-129714112) how the component API would evolve. Every check has a cost so we wouldn‚Äôt want to add more than one. This would also not work if `render` was defined as an instance method, such as with the class property syntax.

So instead, React [added](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4663) a special flag to the base component. React checks for the presence of that flag, and that‚Äôs how it knows whether something is a React component class or not.

Originally the flag was on the base `React.Component` class itself:

```jsx
// Inside React
class Component {}
Component.isReactClass = {};

// We can check it like this
class Greeting extends Component {}
console.log(Greeting.isReactClass); // ‚úÖ Yes
```

However, some class implementations we wanted to target [did not](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/1900) copy static properties (or set the non-standard `__proto__`), so the flag was getting lost.

This is why React [moved](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5021) this flag to `React.Component.prototype`: 

```jsx
// Inside React
class Component {}
Component.prototype.isReactComponent = {};

// We can check it like this
class Greeting extends Component {}
console.log(Greeting.prototype.isReactComponent); // ‚úÖ Yes
```

**And this is literally all there is to it.**

You might be wondering why it‚Äôs an object and not just a boolean. It doesn‚Äôt matter much in practice but early versions of Jest (before Jest was Good‚Ñ¢Ô∏è) had automocking turned on by default. The generated mocks omitted primitive properties, [breaking the check](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4663#issuecomment-136533373). Thanks, Jest.

The `isReactComponent` check is [used in React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/769b1f270e1251d9dbdce0fcbd9e92e502d059b8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js#L297-L300) to this day.

If you don‚Äôt extend `React.Component`, React won‚Äôt find `isReactComponent` on the prototype, and won‚Äôt treat component as a class. Now you know why [the most upvoted answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42680526/458193) for `Cannot call a class as a function` error is to add `extends React.Component`. Finally, a [warning was added](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11168) that warns when `prototype.render` exists but `prototype.isReactComponent` doesn‚Äôt.

---

You might say this story is a bit of a bait-and-switch. **The actual solution is really simple, but I went on a huge tangent to explain *why* React ended up with this solution, and what the alternatives were.**

In my experience, that‚Äôs often the case with library APIs. For an API to be simple to use, you often need to consider the language semantics (possibly, for several languages, including future directions), runtime performance, ergonomics with and without compile-time steps, the state of the ecosystem and packaging solutions, early warnings, and many other things. The end result might not always be the most elegant, but it must be practical.

**If the final API is successful, _its users_ never have to think about this process.** Instead they can focus on creating apps.

But if you‚Äôre also curious... it‚Äôs nice to know how it works.
