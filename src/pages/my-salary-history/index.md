title: My Salary History
date: '2019-03-12'
spoiler: My disclosure of what I've earned over time.

Note: this article is currently outdated. I intend to update sometime in the next six months.

The purpose of this article is for me to share what I've made in every job I've taken to provide a slight bit more
transparency into what employers pay. Employees not sharing salaries is a stupid tradition. For a market to function
fairly, there must be transparency - a way to tell if you're getting ripped off. In particular, women and POC [^1] do
frequently get [^2] paid less than men for the same work. Without reference numbers, it's very difficult for an
individual employee to tell if they're getting ripped off. Sites like Glassdoor can help with this problem but a) it
makes me very uncomfortable that you have to provide personal data to a corporation to get information crucial to your
livelihood and b) anonymized data is inherently less useful. You know nothing of their professional history - it's just
a slightly lessened informational asymmertry.

And below can be found what I've made in each job along with a short description of it. I will be updating this each
time I take a new job. Note that I have tried to convert to an hourly rate wherever possible. If you have questions,

  The actual pay gap between women and men is not nearly as big as the 73 cents per dollar figure would imply. Stuff
  like the fact that paternal leave is rarely provided and/or taken or that men negotiate more than women are large
  sources of this disparity - neither will be solved by eliminating direct compensation discrimination.
