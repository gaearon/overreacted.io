It's been a while since I've posted any personal/professional updates.

As some of you might know, I left Meta in July 2023. I wanted to take a long break from work around then--but I got excited about Bluesky being at the intersection of all my interests (React, open source, being addicted to Twitter) and I've spent the next (almost) two years there. I've learned some of the ins and outs of React Native, helped the team get the app a lot more polished, and also did a little bit of engineering management. Then I realized I *actually needed* a long break, and it could not wait any further. So I left and have been free-floating for a few months.

I'm in-between things now. It's a weird time because I don't understand what's going to happen to my skillset. Both in terms of actual software engineering and in terms of teaching people. How both of these things get done is evolving. I don't know where my field is going, and I don't have an obvious "next" thing that I want to do. So for now I'll sit by the river and watch whatever's happening float by.

I've revived this blog. Mostly writing about React Server Components because I had a bunch of things I wanted to be able to point people to that had no definitive URLs. I'm not sure if I'm running out of posts yet. There's a few more things I'd like to write about--like [atproto](http://atproto.com/) and [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)--but I can't quite get into the mindset of moving on from RSC writing. Maybe I need to fully exhaust that stream first.

**Anyway, per the post title--I'm doing a little consulting now.**

I'm not writing code, but if you or your team needs some technical guidance in UI engineering (my expertise is mostly around React and React Native), I may be able to help. We can talk about your architectural challenges, performance challenges, dive deep into specific technical issues, or talk about higher-level approaches to product and infra development. I've been lucky to work with great engineers at both Meta and at Bluesky, and I enjoy the chance to pass on what I've learned.

The format is a 1:1 hourly call. We can do a single one at first, and extend to several sessions if you find it beneficial and/or want to follow up. This will probably work best for technical leaders (or very motivated learners). It is unfortunately not free (somebody asked me that so I have to clarify). If this sounds interesting, drop an email at `dan.abramov.consulting@gmail.com`, and I'll reply if I can help.

Thanks!
