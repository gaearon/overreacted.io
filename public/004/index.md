## 🔥 Cover Story

OmniParser（[ˈɑːmniˌpɑːrsər]） is a screen - parsing tool developed by Microsoft Research. Here is a detailed introduction:

### Basic Information

- It is a comprehensive method for parsing user - interface screenshots into structured and easy - to - understand elements. It significantly enhances the ability of GPT - 4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface.

### Functions and Features

- **Parse UI screenshots**: It can parse screen screenshots of user interfaces into structured elements, including interactive icons and text.
- **Identify interactive regions**: It uses a specialized detection model to identify and mark interactive regions in the UI, such as buttons and icons.
- **Extract functional semantics**: It extracts the functional semantics of the detected elements through a description model and generates descriptions related to user tasks.
- **Enhance agent performance**: Combined with the parsing results, it improves the performance and accuracy of UI agents based on large - language models when performing tasks.
- **Cross - platform application**: It supports a variety of operating systems and applications, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and a variety of web browsers and desktop applications.
- **No additional information required**: It does not rely on additional information such as HTML or view hierarchies, and independently extracts necessary data from visual screenshots.

### Technical Principles

- **Detection model**: It uses the YOLOv8 model to fine - tune on the interactive icon - detection dataset to identify and locate the interactive regions in the UI.
- **OCR module**: It integrates an optical character recognition (OCR) module to extract text on the screen and combines it with the icon - detection results to remove highly overlapping bounding boxes.
- **Action prediction**: It combines structured elements and functional semantics to reduce the burden on large - language models during action prediction and more accurately convert predicted actions into actual actions on the screen.

### Application Scenarios

- **Virtual assistants**: It enhances the ability of AI assistants to understand and navigate GUI - based applications, allowing them to provide more helpful and contextual support.
- **Automation and workflow tools**: It leverages the structured representation of UI elements to automate repetitive tasks and streamline human - computer interactions.
- **UI testing and quality assurance**: It automatically validates the functionality and usability of GUI - based software, reducing the burden on human testers.
- **Accessibility and inclusive design**: It improves the accessibility of applications by identifying and describing interactive components for users with visual or motor impairments.

## 👋 Hello jotai

Jotai takes an atomic approach to global React state management.

Build state by combining atoms and renders are automatically optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context, eliminates the need for memoization, and provides a similar developer experience to signals while maintaining a declarative programming model.

It scales from a simple `useState` replacement to an enterprise TypeScript application with complex requirements. Plus there are plenty of utilities and extensions to help you along the way!

### Features

- Minimal core API (2kb)
- Many utilities and extensions
- TypeScript oriented
- Works with Next.js, Waku, Remix, and React Native

### Core

Jotai has a very minimal API, exposing only a few exports from the main jotai bundle. They are split into four categories below.

- **atom**: The atom function is to create an atom config. We call it "atom config" as it's just a definition and it doesn't yet hold a value. We may also call it just "atom" if the context is clear.
- **useAtom**: The `useAtom` hook is used to read an atom from the state. The state can be seen as a WeakMap of atom configs and atom values.
- **Store**
    - **createStore**: This function is to create a new empty store. The store can be used to pass in **Provider**.
    - **getDefaultStore**: This function returns a default store that is used in provider-less mode.
- **Provider**
    - **Provider**: Provider component is to provide state for a component sub tree. Multiple Providers can be used for multiple subtrees, and they can even be nested. This works just like React Context.
    - **useStore**: This hook returns a store within the component tree.
