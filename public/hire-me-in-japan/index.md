My sabbatical is soon coming to an end, and I am looking for a new job.

In particular, I am looking for a job at a company that would like to **sponsor a working visa for me in Japan**, where I'd like to relocate within the next year.

If you can sponsor a software engineering visa in Japan and think I might be a good fit, please email `dan.abramov.japan@gmail.com`. Below I'll recap some of my past work, with more details re: what I'm looking for near the end of this page.

### Past Work

Hi! My name is Dan Abramov.

I started programming about 20 years ago and then I couldn't stop--so I've been doing software for over 15 years professionally. I've dabbled in different languages, but the vast majority of my recent work has been in JavaScript and TypeScript.

Here's a few things I have worked on over the years.

#### 2025: Consulting

This year, [I've been doing consulting](/im-doing-a-little-consulting/), so there isn't much I can say publicly.

Mostly, I've been consulting teams using React on how to approach engineering challenges related to performance and state management in complex apps.

On the side, I've been [contributing](https://github.com/teorth/analysis/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agaearon+is%3Aclosed) to Terence Tao's [Analysis textbook in Lean](https://github.com/teorth/analysis).

#### 2023–2025: The Bluesky app

From 2023 to 2025, I worked on the official [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) client app (in React Native). Most of my engineering work focused on [improving the app quality](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/1675), for example:

- [Implementing animations for the lightbox](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/6048)
- [Synchronizing feed swipe animations with gestures](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/6868)
- [Introducing custom lint rules to prevent runtime crashes](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/3398)
- [Shaving off seconds from Android start time](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/1756)

Some of this work required multi-week deep dives and sprawling refactors.

- [Rewriting the lightbox to work well on Android](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/1624)
- [Reworking the cross-platform layout to work well on the web](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/2126)
- [Revamping how threads show up in the feed](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/4871)
- [Revamping the post composer into a thread composer](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/5962)

The Bluesky app is open source; here's a link to my [other merged pull requests](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agaearon+is%3Amerged+).

We've used a lot of open source software at Bluesky, and sometimes it could be difficult to trace down where a bug is coming from. Occasionally, I've had to do deep dive investigations into the underlying projects to file bugs or fixes there.

- [Reducing the Reanimated serialization traffic](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/6219)
- [Fixing a 10 year old ScrollView bug in React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/47591)
- [Documenting the difficulties in getting gestures to work with ScrollView](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues/2616#issuecomment-2525238174)

In addition to my individual engineering work, I've done some engineering management and mentoring on the application team. This included:

- Helping the team get a natural mental model for working with React.
- Mentoring the application team on how to root cause particularly gnarly issues.
- Pushing for a closer collaboration with the backend team so that the seams from the client/server organizational split don't "show up" as poor UX in the product.

I've also helped the team explain the AT protocol to a broader community--first in a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1sJW6nTP6E) last year, which then crystallized into my recent article called [Open Social](/open-social/).

#### 2015–2023: React at Meta/Facebook

Before Bluesky, I used to work on the React team at Meta (formerly Facebook). Some of the more visible projects I was involved with include:

- The [React Documentation](https://react.dev/), which I co-wrote with [Rachel Lee Nabors](https://nearestnabors.com/) and [others](https://react.dev/community/docs-contributors). My work on it included designing the Learn section curriculum, iterating on the Reference page structure, a decent chunk of technical work on the website itself, and much of the actual writing, including the design of examples and challenges.
- The public messaging and rollout of React Hooks, including the original documentation for React Hooks and the conference talk introducing them.
- Implementing Fast Refresh (hot reloading / live editing) as a first-class React feature. It feels like a distant past, but we used to press Cmd+R to see our edits.
- Co-creating [Create React App](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html), which ended the "JavaScript fatigue" (allegedly).

I've also done [some other technical work on React over the years](https://github.com/facebook/react/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agaearon+is%3Amerged+), which mostly consisted of fixing bugs and [occasionally](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2017/12/15/improving-the-repository-infrastructure.html) revamping the build infrastructure.

Outside of my job, I co-created [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/), which is a half-book half-course introduction to thinking in JavaScript, aiming to be both whimsical *and* rigorous.

#### Before 2015

I haven't done many publicly notable things before getting hired at Facebook, other than accidentally co-creating [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as a demo for my conference talk.

I've previously worked at a small product company that didn't succeed doing some JavaScript and C#, and before that at an outsourcing firm where I mostly did C#.

I also created [React Hot Loader](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) (a very early precursor to Fast Refresh, now built into React), [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/), and [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) (which was used by Twitter for some time).

### Looking Forward

As you can tell from the above, most of my engineering expertise lies in the field of UI engineering, web development in particular, and of course in using React. I'd love an opportunity to share my expertise and to help you create better apps.

I enjoy sharing what I learned, which is why I blog and do [talks](https://danabra.mov/). Although I prefer when I can work on open source software, this will not be a requirement for me.

Currently I feel most comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript. I've [recently](/the-math-is-haunted/) [picked](/beyond-booleans/) [up](/a-lean-syntax-primer/) some Lean, and working with it professionally seems alluring (if unlikely). I've been using LLMs quite a bit recently too and am open to working with them more. In general, I'm open to learning new things on the job (for example, I've learned React Native while at Bluesky!) but a new stack may require some ramp-up time.

I care about the *quality* of what I'm working on, whether it's an app, a developer tool, or a course. I hope to find a job where caring about quality is appreciated. I know fixing things "the right way" isn't always possible, but I feel most useful when I'm able to dig into the root causes, and work with others on solving them.

To sum up, I'm looking for a software engineering job... in Japan.

### Why Japan

Why indeed!

The honest answer is that the feeling of home has moved, and so now I must try to move along with it. I don't know how it happened exactly. My wife and I first visited Japan a year ago, staying for a few months in Kyoto. After coming home to London, we realized that something was off, so this spring we came back to Kyoto for a few more months. And now we're back in Kyoto for a few more months again. (Big thanks to the [Vue Fes Japan 2025](https://vuefes.jp/2025/) organizers for covering our recent flights!)

Paying rent in both cities is expensive, flights are disruptive, and we want to adopt a cat, so we have to choose. We've loved spending a whole decade in London, but this decade, Kyoto feels right. The question isn't whether to move but--*can it be?*

I haven't learned Japanese yet, which significantly limits my options. I've learned hiragana and katakana during the last trip, so now I'm focused on N5 grammar and vocab. I pick up my speed a bit slowly so I expect Japanese to take me a while.

Since I don't speak Japanese yet *and* I'm hoping to relocate to Kyoto, I suspect that the most promising option to obtain a work visa will either be an international company with a Japanese presence, or a Japanese company that permits remote work (I assume there aren't many tech opportunities in Kyoto itself!) and that does most of the work-related communication in English. (I do hope to get to a fluent level of Japanese eventually, but that will likely take me at least a few more years.)

I know there aren't many options like this, but fingers crossed. I'm talking to a few companies but I would like to get a better sense of the options--hence this post. My hope is to find a real job that lets me come back with a working visa (rather than as a tourist, like now) and to settle down in Japan for the foreseeable future.

**If you would like to explore working with me and can sponsor my work visa in Japan, please reach out via `dan.abramov.japan@gmail.com` and let me know!**

And if you know someone who might, any leads and intros are very appreciated.

Thank you.

Dan
