## 🔥 Cover Story

HaaS (Headless Browser as a Service) redefines browser automation by offering scalable, cloud-based solutions for tasks like web scraping, testing, and AI agent interactions. Unlike traditional browser setups, HaaS eliminates infrastructure maintenance costs and optimizes resource usage through pay-as-you-go models, ensuring cost efficiency for intermittent demands.

Key innovations include:

1. **​​AI-Native Capabilities**​​: Services like BrowserBase integrate LLMs and VLMs to enable natural language interactions, allowing AI agents to navigate dynamic web elements (e.g., login forms) autonomously.
​2. **​Performance & Flexibility**​​: Compared to DIY setups or general cloud testing platforms, HaaS specializes in headless automation, supporting complex interactions (clicking, scrolling) without GUI overhead.
3. **​​Scalability​**​: Kubernetes-backed services ensure 24/7 reliability, while APIs streamline integration with existing workflows.

HaaS is pivotal for AI-driven tasks, data extraction, and cross-browser testing, reducing latency and operational burdens. As bots account for 40%+ web traffic, HaaS positions itself as the backbone of tomorrow’s automated web interactions.

## 👋 Hello Browser-Use

🌐 Browser-use is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser.

1、make sure python>=3.11

```sh
uv venv --python 3.11
```

2、Install browser-use

```sh
pip install browser-use
```

2、Install Playwright

```sh
playwright install chromium
```

3、Spin up your agent:

> This demo uses Custom OpenAI service with GPT-4 model, so you need to set your OpenAI API key and Base Url

```sh
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.browser.browser import Browser, BrowserConfig

import asyncio

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    base_url="https://xxx/",
    api_key="xxx",
    model="gpt-4o",
    temperature=0.0,
    timeout=1000,  # Increase for complex tasks
)

browser = Browser(
    config=BrowserConfig(
        # NOTE: you need to close your chrome browser - so that this can open your browser in debug mode
        chrome_instance_path=r"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome",
    )
)


async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task=f"Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=llm,
        browser=browser,
        use_vision=False,
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)
