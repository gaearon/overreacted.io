## üî• Cover Story

Vibe Coding, the most rebellious code philosophy of 2025. It was proposed by Andrej Karpathy, a former core member of OpenAI, with the core idea of ‚Äúletting developers lie completely flat and give their souls to AI‚Äù. Imagine: you no longer need to struggle with Python indentation or JavaScript closures, just like a friend and nagging to the AI said: ‚ÄúAdd a cyber neon effect to the sidebar, to be that kind of Blade Runner 2049 decadence‚Äù, the code will automatically flow out. This is no longer ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù in the traditional sense, but a ‚Äúhuman-computer stream-of-consciousness dialog‚Äù - the developer is like a director, and the AI is the director. The developer is like a director, the AI is a full-fledged field worker, and the code becomes a by-product of improvisation.

Vibe Coding is like love - you don't need to fully understand each other, just keep the ambiguous ‚Äúvibe‚Äù. It may have ended the era of the ‚Äúcoder‚Äù, but it has given rise to a new species of ‚Äúdigital bard‚Äù. As Karpathy puts it, ‚ÄúWhen code works, it's functional; when it doesn't work, it's performance art.‚Äù This revolution is proving that the most elegant code may not even need to be read by humans.

But the opposition fears that programmers are degenerating into ‚ÄúAI tamers‚Äù and that code bases are becoming black box art. For instance, Maximilian believes that "vibe coding" is not his futureÔºö

### valibot - The modular and type safe schema library for validating structural data ü§ñ

```js
import v from 'valibot';

// Create login schema with email and password
const loginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.string([v.email()]),
  password: v.string([v.minLength(8)]),
});

// Infer output TypeScript type of login schema as
type LoginData = v.InferOutput<typeof LoginSchema>;

// Throws error for email and password
const output1 = v.parse(LoginSchema, { email: '', password: '' });

// Returns data as {email: string, password: string}
const output2 = v.parse(LoginSchema, {
  email: 'jane@example.com',
  password: '12345678',
})
```

Why valibotÔºü

1. **‚ÄãTree-Shaking & Bundle Size Optimization**
  - Small, independent functions allow bundlers (e.g., Webpack, Rollup) to ‚Äãeliminate unused code via static import analysis.
‚Äã  - Result: Up to ‚Äã95% smaller bundle size compared to monolithic libraries (e.g., Zod).
‚Äã2. **Extensibility & Flexibility**
  - Modular functions enable ‚Äãeasy integration with external code.
  - Users can ‚Äãselectively import only what they need, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

## üëã Hello Wasp

> A Journey Through the new skill I learned

This Week I learned about Wasp, a new open-source web framework for building modern web applications. Wasp is built on top of the Next.js framework, and it provides a new way to build web applications.

It is an opinionated way of building full-stack web applications. It takes care of all three major parts of a web application: client (front-end), server (back-end) and database.

At the core is the Wasp compiler which takes the Wasp config and your Javascript code and outputs the client app, server app and deployment code.

![](https://wasp.sh/img/lp/wasp-compilation-diagram.png)

Let's create and run our first Wasp app in 3 short steps:

1. **To install Wasp on Linux / OSX / WSL (Windows), open your terminal and run:**
  ```sh
  curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh
  ```
**2. Then, create a new app by running:**
  ```sh
  wasp new
  ```
**3. Finally, run the app:**
  ```sh
  cd <my-project-name>
  wasp start
  ```

That's it üéâ You have successfully created and served a new full-stack web app at http://localhost:3000 and Wasp is serving both frontend and backend for you.
