## üî• Cover Story

**Trump‚Äôs 2025 Reciprocal Tariff Policy**

Announced on April 2, 2025 (‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù), Trump‚Äôs **reciprocal tariff policy** mandates that the U.S. impose tariffs equivalent to those levied by other nations on American goods. Key features:

1. **Scope**: Targets countries like China, the EU, Japan, and others imposing tariffs **above 10%** on U.S. exports (e.g., steel, aluminum, automobiles, electronics).
2. **Auto Tariffs**: Raises import car tariffs to **25%** (from 2.5%), affecting German, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese automakers.
3. **Universal Tariff Proposal**: A potential **20% flat tariff** on all imports to reduce trade deficits.

**Objectives**: Reduce reliance on foreign goods, revive U.S. manufacturing, and counter perceived ‚Äúunfair practices‚Äù like subsidies or currency manipulation.

**Global Impact**: Risks escalating trade wars (e.g., EU retaliation on pork/luxury cars, China targeting agriculture), disrupting supply chains, and fueling inflation. Critics argue the policy is less about reciprocity and more a protectionist tool, potentially destabilizing WTO frameworks.

**Economic Impact**: The S&P 500 index plunged 4.8%, with about $2 trillion in market value evaporated. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq fell 4% and 6% respectively. Asian and European stock markets also declined simultaneously. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2.7% in the morning session, and the UK's FTSE 100 index closed down 1.5%.

This strategy reflects Trump‚Äôs broader ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù agenda, prioritizing economic leverage over multilateral cooperation.
